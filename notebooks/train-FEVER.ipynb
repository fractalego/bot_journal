      "Cristiano Ronaldo dos Santos Aveiro, ([kɾiʃ ` tjɐnu ʁuˈnaɫdu], born 5 February 1985) is a Portuguese professional footballer for Spanish club Real Madrid and the Portugal national team. He primarily plays as a forward, but has also been deployed as a winger and serves as captain for Portugal. In 2008, he won his first Ballon d'Or and FIFA World Player of the Year awards. Ronaldo then won the FIFA Ballon d'Or in 2013 and 2014. In 2016, he received his fourth Ballon d'Or, the most for a European player in the history of the award, and the inaugural Best FIFA Men 's Player. In 2015, Ronaldo scored his 500th senior career goal for club and country. Two years later, he surpassed Jimmy Greaves as the all-time top-scorer in the top five European leagues. Often ranked the best player in the world and widely regarded as one of the greatest of all time, Ronaldo was named the best Portuguese player of all time by the Portuguese Football Federation, during its 100th anniversary celebrations in 2015James Peter Greaves (born 20 February 1940) is a former England international footballer who played as a forward. He is England 's fourth highest international goalscorer (44 goals), Tottenham Hotspur 's highest ever goalscorer (266 goals), the highest goalscorer in the history of English top-flight football (357 goals), and has also scored more hat-tricks (six) for England than anyone else. He finished as the First Division 's top scorer in six seasons. He is a member of the English Football Hall of Fame. Greaves began his professional career at Chelsea in 1957, and played in the following year 's FA Youth Cup final. He scored 124 First Division goals in just four seasons before being sold on to Italian club A.C. Milan for # 80,000 in April 1961. His stay in Italy was not a happy one and he returned to England with Tottenham Hotspur for a fee of # 99,999 in December 1961. Whilst with Spurs he won the FA Cup in 1961 -- 62 and 1966 -- 67, the Charity Shield in 1962 and 1967, and the European Cup Winners ' Cup in 1962 -- 63; he never won a league title but did help Spurs to a second-place finish in 1962 -- 63.\n",
